/**
 * Login is the slowest request this app makes, and it is slow only when it
 * succeeds: a rejected credential comes back in about four seconds, while an
 * accepted one goes on to scrape a profile. See lib/auth/pesu.ts.
 *
 * Server actions inherit the segment config of the page that invokes them, so
 * this ceiling covers `signIn`. On a serverless host the platform's own cap
 * still applies and is usually lower — 60s on Vercel Hobby — which is why
 * PESU_AUTH_TIMEOUT_MS has to leave room for a retry inside it rather than
 * being set to the largest number that looks safe.
