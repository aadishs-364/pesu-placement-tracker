 * were produced by the spreadsheet, independently of anything here. If the
 * database reproduces them, the import is right. If it does not, the import is
 * wrong, and this reports that rather than quietly adjusting expectations.
 *
 * One check does not depend on a footer: the headcounts stored on `DriveRole`
 * against the offer rows expanded from them. That comparison is entirely
 * internal, so it holds for a workbook that publishes no totals at all, and it
 * is what stops the expansion drifting from the figures it came from.
