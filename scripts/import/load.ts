 * Two things here are less obvious than they look.
 *
 * 1. A company appearing on both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 tabs is ONE visit whose
 *    roles happened to fall in different tiers — Infosys is on both. A company
 *    appearing twice on the SAME tab genuinely came twice — HSBC did. So blocks
 *    are merged across sheets and split within a sheet.
 *
 * 2. Tier belongs to the role, not the company. Cognizant's Senior Associate is
