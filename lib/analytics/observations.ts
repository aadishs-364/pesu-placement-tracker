/**
 * The live observation layer.
 *
 * Every statistic this application shows about a batch is built from student
 * submissions, and from nothing else. One submission is one person: their
 * package, their branch, their CGPA, the rounds they actually sat.
 *
 * This file used to union submissions with the rows imported from the placement
 * spreadsheets, and every aggregate averaged across both. That conflated two
 * quantities that are not the same thing — a company ADVERTISED 60 LPA, and a
 * student RECEIVED 60 LPA — and it meant the headline numbers for a live batch
 * were mostly a restatement of a spreadsheet nobody is maintaining any more.
 *
 * The imported layer is now history and is read only where history is the
 * point: `getCompanyHistory` below, which the company profile uses to show what
 * a recruiter did in previous years. It never reaches an aggregate. A batch
 * with no submissions reports honest emptiness rather than a borrowed number.
 *
 * The separation is no longer a separation of TABLES — imported placements are
 * `Offer` rows too, so that an archived year has the same shape as a live one
 * instead of three integers on a column. It is a separation by `Offer.source`,
 * and every query below that describes students filters on it explicitly.
