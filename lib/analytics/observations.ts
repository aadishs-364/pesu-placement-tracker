/**
 * The observation layer.
 *
 * Every statistic this application shows about a batch is built from student
 * reports. One row is one person: their package, their branch, their CGPA, the
 * rounds they actually sat.
 *
 * That includes the seasons that arrived by spreadsheet. Those workbooks are
 * student-maintained, so a sheet row and an app submission are the same kind of
 * record collected two different ways — there is no provenance distinction to
 * preserve, and no reason to read one through different code than the other.
 * What the sheets do not tell us is IDENTITY, which is what `studentId` being
 * null on those rows already says. It is not a claim that they are lesser
 * evidence.
 *
 * So nothing here filters on `source`. A 2022 row and a 2027 row are read the
 * same way, which is the entire point of expanding those headcounts into offers
 * instead of leaving them as integers on a column. The one place the
 * distinction still matters is inference OVER people — `detectOutlier` and
 * `recomputeCorroboration` — where N rows expanded from one published figure
 * are one observation and must not be counted as N.
